Python SuperSmoother
====================

This is an efficient implementation of Friedman's SuperSmoother [1]
algorithm in pure Python. It makes use of [numpy](http://numpy.org)
for fast numerical computation.

Installation
------------
Installation is simple: To install the released version, type

    $ pip install supersmoother

To install the bleeding-edge source, download the source code from http://github.com/jakevdp/supersmoother and type:

    $ python setup.py install

The only package dependency is ``numpy``; ``scipy`` is also required if you want to run the unit tests.

Example
-------
The package includes several example notebooks showing the code in action.
You can see these in the ``examples/`` directory, or view them statically
[on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/supersmoother/blob/master/examples/Index.ipynb)

Testing
-------
This code has full unit tests implemented in [pytest](https://pytest.org). With ``pytest`` installed, you can run the test suite using
```
$ pytest
```
The package is tested with Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.
